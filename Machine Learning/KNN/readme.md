###Description
It is a simple classifier used for handwriting digits recognition based on KNN algorithm. The codes are based on the examples in the book ***Machine Learning in Action***(Chapter 2).

###Document

 - **KNN.py** : this is the core of the algorithm, containing classify function
 - **recognition.py** : Handwriting digits recognition based on KNN algorithm, it will take almost 2000 samples as train data set.
 - **img2txt.py** : transform an image to txt file so that it can be used in recognition
  > **Note:** the image file should be gray-scaled and the expected resolution is 32 *32. Since this is just a practice for learning ML, I have't consider other cases. Sorry. 
  > **Data set:** All the training and testing data set are in the folder "digit", provided by [UCI](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/)
